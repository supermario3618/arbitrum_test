Professional README Guide
A polished GitHub profile is an important part of your public identity as a developer. Why? For one thing, it will most likely be the first place that potential employers look to evaluate your skills and professionalism. And it also allows you to connect with and showcase your work to other developers, which can lead to interesting collaborations.

A key component of your profile, and one that many new developers overlook, is the README file that's associated with each respository. A README file acts like a virtual storefront to a repositoryâ€”it's the first thing that a person sees when they visit a repo on GitHub. But it's also much more than that: README files contain essential information about the repo's project. Thus, the quality of a README file can differentiate a high-quality repo from a low-quality one.

There's no one right way to structure a README file. There is one very wrong way, however, and that is to not include a README at all or to create a very sparse one.

To help you create high-quality READMEs from the start, this guide outlines some basic best practices for creating them. As you progress in your career, you'll develop your own ideas about what makes an effective README file.

What Should a High-Quality README Contain?
A high-quality README file explains what your application does and why you used the technologies that you did. At a bare minimum, a README needs a title and a short description explaining the what, why, and how of the project.

Use the following questions as a guide:

What was your motivation?
Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
What problem does it solve?
What did you learn?
What makes your project stand out?
Your README might also describe some of the challenges you faced, as well as the features you plan to implement in the future. And if your project is deployed, make sure to include a link to the deployed application so people can see it in action!

How Do I Create a High-Quality README File?
README files are written in Markdown, and are always named README.md (note that README is in all caps). If you're new to Markdown, refer to the GitHub guide on mastering markdown or search the internet for Markdown tutorials.

For a great example of a high-quality README file, visit Microsoft's VS Code repository.
